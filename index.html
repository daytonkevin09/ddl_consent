                            across the consolidated data which our clients can then access through their custom reports.

<h3>1) Information we may collect </h3>
The type of information we collect will depend on the circumstances and the service you are using. Generally speaking, we will collect information relating to you and/or your use of our services in the following ways: 
<p></p>
<h4>Information relating to your use of the website</h4>
We collect information about how you use our website. This includes information relating to the pages you visit on our website, the services or information your search for and the links and content you choose to access. We may also use the personal information you provide through your use of our website to provide you with relevant content and to inform our marketing strategy. This type of activity is known as “profiling” – using automated means to process your personal data to analyse or predict your personal preferences, interest or behaviours. You can object to profiling (see section 7 of this Notice, below).

 <p></p><h4>Technical data</h4>
We collect information about the device(s) you use to access our site. This includes collecting unique mobile device ID or the internet protocol (IP) address online identifiers, which are numbers that can uniquely identify a specific computer or other network device on the internet. This information is linked to a cookie ID, which we receive and process. You may find more information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them on our separate Cookie Notice (available here: https://www.dentsuaegisnetwork.com/policies/cookies-notice).

<p></p><h4>Contact data</h4>
We collect contact details when you sign-up to receive email alerts, attend one of our events, download our content, subscribe to our newsletters or where you ask us to respond to a query you have. The personal data we collect includes your name, email address, job title, and location. 

<p></p><h4>Marketing and communications data</h4>

If you have any concerns about your child’s privacy in relation to our services, or if you believe that your child may have entered personal data onto our website, please contact us at dpo@dentsuaegis.com. We will delete such information from our records within a reasonable time. 

<p></p><h3>2. How we use this information</h3>

Except where required by law, we use the personal data you provide for the following purposes: 
<p></p>
to deliver the specific information or services you have requested;<p></p>
to enable the download of our content;<p></p>
send you newsletters and information relating to our brands and services;<p></p>
respond to your requests and feedback; and <p></p>
analyse and/or improve our services. <p></p>
Under data protection law we are required to advise you on the legal basis for processing your personal data. For the most part, the processing of your personal information is based either on a) our legitimate interests related to us providing you services you have requested or otherwise your customer relationship with us, or b) your consent, where requested. 
<p></p>
In the table below we set out further information about the purposes for which we use your personal data and the legal basis we rely on for its use. Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful basis depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data.

<h3>3. How long we will keep your information </h3>
We will keep your personal data for as long as is necessary for the relevant service, in accordance with our legal obligations. After this time, your personal data will either be securely deleted or anonymised so that it can be used for analytical purposes. You may request further information via the contact details given in this Privacy Notice.
<p></p>
<h3>4. How we secure your information</h3>

We maintain appropriate organisational and technological safeguards to help protect against unauthorised use, access to or accidental loss, alteration or destruction of personal data. We also seek to ensure our service providers do the same. 
<p></p>
<h3>5. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

<h4>Information shared with our third-party service providers</h4>

We use a number of third parties to perform business functions on our behalf, such as sending our newsletters and hosting our online services and customer relationship management. We will only disclose the information necessary to enable these third parties to perform their services. Our service providers are contracted to comply with our instructions and we require that they do not use your personal data for their own business purpose. 

<h4>Information shared with other parties</h4>

Where required or permitted by law, personal data may be provided to others, such as regulator and law enforcement agencies, for example in response to a court order or a subpoena, or in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, and as otherwise required by law. 

<p>We do not sell or rent any personal data about you to any third party.</p>

<h3>6. International and group company transfers</h3>

Dentsu Aegis Network is a globally operating media group consisting of multiple companies. Therefore, we may from time to time disclose your personal data within our group of companies. Access will always be controlled on a need-to-know basis, and only provided where it is necessary to provide you with requested services or to allow us to perform any necessary or legitimate functions. Some of our group companies are located outside the European Union, but we always ensure the security of such disclosures and transfers in accordance with the applicable privacy and data protection laws.

We will only transfer your personal data outside the EU, where we are satisfied that adequate levels of protection are in place to protect the integrity and security of any information being processed and compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws. These measures may include the use of standard contractual/data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission and where transfers are to the United States of America, the EU-US Privacy Shield, Swiss-US Privacy Shield or your consent. Where we transfer personal data between our group companies we have covered these transfers by entering into standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission.  

You may request further information on the measures used for such transfers via the contact details given in this Privacy Notice.
<p></p>
<h3>7. Your rights</h3>

<p>Object to our processing of your personal data where we are relying on legitimate interest (or those of a third-party), and you want to object to processing on this ground, as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have a right to object where we are processing your personal data for the purposes of direct marketing or profiling. You can object at any time and we shall stop processing the information you have objected to, unless we can show compelling legitimate grounds to continue that processing.</p>
<p>Access your personal data. If you make this kind of request and we hold personal data about you. We are required to provide you with information on it, including a description and copy of the personal data and why we are processing it. We will require you to prove your identity before granting access to your personal data. We will process your request within the timeframe required under the relevant law.</p>
<p>Request the transfer of your personal data. We will provide to you or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note, this right applies to the personal data you have provided to us; and if we use your personal data on the basis of consent or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p>Request erasure (deletion) of your personal data.  You have a right to ask us to delete or remove your data where you have successfully exercised your right to object (see above), or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Please note, we may be required to retain certain information by law and/or for our own legitimate business purpose. But when we do so, we will inform you</p>
<p>Request correction or updating of your personal data. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected.</p>
<p>Request the restriction of our processing of your personal data in some situations. If you request this, we can continue to store your personal data but are restricted from processing it while the restriction is in place.</p>
<p>Withdraw your consent. Where you have provided your consent to our processing of your personal data you can withdraw your consent at any time. If you do withdraw consent, that will not affect the lawfulness of what we have done with your personal data before you withdrew consent.</p>
<p>Make a Complaint. We will do our best to resolve any complaint. However, if you feel we have not resolved your complaint, you have a right to make a complaint to your local data protection authority. For example, in the UK, the local data protection authority is the UK Information Commissioner's Office.</p>
<p>If you exercise the rights above and there is any question about who you are, we may require you to provide information from which we can satisfy ourselves as to your identity.</p>
